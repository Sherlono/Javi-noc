You guessed it. Small, medium and big are the types of buildings depending on how many sprites it takes to draw them.
This project taught me how to make and manage a vector of pointers to custom classes as well as a little bit about the limitations of the GBAs VRAM.
Hopefully I will find a less time consuming way of creating complicated graphics such as the oscillating string.
